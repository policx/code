I think the greatest value of learning how to think.... I think everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer, should learn a computer language, because it teaches you how to think, it’s like going to law school, I don’t think anybody should be a lawyer, but I think going to law school may actually be useful coz it teaches you how to think in a certain way. In the same way the computer programming teaches you in a slightly different way how to think... And so … I view computer science as a liberal art. It should be something everybody takes in a year in their life, one of the courses they take is, you know learning how to program.

我认为学习思考最大的价值在于... 我觉得所有美国人都应该学习编程，学习一门编程语言，学习编程教你如何思考，就像学法律一样，学法律的人未必都成为律师，但法律教你一种思考方式。同样编程会教你另一种思考方式，所以我把计算机科学看成基础教育，是每个人都应该花一年时间学习的课程。.
